## Scenario for the Project

You are working for a new startup, Grade Calculator. Its grading system allows tertiary education institutions to calculate the grades of Level 5 and Level 6 students.

The previous Software Engineer started building the application but was urgently re-assigned to a different part of the business. You need to complete the remaining user stories for the web application, following the documentation below.

Your Tech Lead can support you if you need help understanding the requirements or are blocked with something in particular.
